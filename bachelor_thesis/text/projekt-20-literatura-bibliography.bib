    ABSTRACT = {The formation and invariance of the canine nose pattern is studied. Nose images of ten beagle dogs were collected for ten months from month two to month eleven. The nose patterns in these images are examined visually and by a biometric algorithm. It is found that the canine nose pattern is fully formed at the end of the second month since birth and remains invariant until the end of the eleventh month. This study also strongly indicates that the canine nose pattern can be used as a unique biometric marker for each individual dog.},

    abstract = {Abstract The glabrous skin around the nostrils in mammals is called a rhinarium or planum nasale. Rhinarium skin has multiple epidermal domes that are generally assumed to form a tactile surface. The rhinarium is innervated by a branch of the trigeminal nerve which is associated with stimuli such as touch, chemical irritants and temperature. In this study, our aim was to correlate variation in rhinarium skin sensory innervation with different feeding behaviors while also covering a broad systematic spectrum. Using histological and immunohistological methods, we studied skin morphology, nerve fiber density and nerve fiber distribution in the rhinarium epidermal domes of four species: cow, ring-tailed lemur, brown bear, and dog, that all exhibit different feeding behaviors. All species share similar traits in rhinarium skin morphology, but glands were only found in cow rhinarium skin. The most substantial differences were observed in the innervation pattern. Mechanosensory skin organs were found only in the ring-tailed lemur. Dog epidermal domes possess a pronounced central dermal papilla containing a nerve bundle in its top, close to the skin surface. The abundance of free epidermal nerve fibers in epidermal domes of all species, suggest that the rhinarium skin is a sensory surface, that can be used to detect fine touch, chemical irritants or temperature. In the species where the whole epidermal dome was examined, the intraepidermal nerve fiber density is higher in the central part of the domes. The nerve distribution and the central positioning of a single gland duct in cow and the dermal papilla top organ in dog indicates that each epidermal dome can be considered a functional unit. The observed differences in innervation hint at different sensory functions of rhinaria in mammals that may be correlated to feeding behavior.},

    More work must be done on some phases of the nose-print as a means of identification.

    ABSTRACT = {Currently, invasive and external radio frequency identification (RFID) devices and pet tags are widely used for dog identification. However, social problems such as abandoning and losing dogs are constantly increasing. A more effective alternative to the existing identification method is required and the biometrics can be the alternative. This paper proposes an effective dog muzzle recognition method to identify individual dogs. The proposed method consists of preprocessing, feature extraction, matching, and postprocessing. For preprocessing, proposed resize and histogram equalization are used. For feature extraction algorithm, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF), Binary Robust Invariant Scaling Keypoints (BRISK) and Oriented FAST, and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) are applied and compared. For matching, Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (FLANN) is used for SIFT and SURF, and hamming distance are used for BRISK and ORB. For postprocessing, two techniques to reduce incorrect matches are proposed. The proposed method was evaluated with 55 dog muzzle pattern images acquired from 11 dogs and 990 images augmented by the image deformation (i.e., angle, illumination, noise, affine transform). The best Equal Error Rate (EER) of the proposed method was 0.35\%, and ORB was the most appropriate for the dog muzzle pattern recognition.},

        abstract = { Similar to human biometrics such as faces and fingerprints, animals also have biometrics for individual identifiers. This research paper works on biometrics of cattle using images of muzzle patterns. The proposed approach begins with a training process to construct a cattle face localization model using a Haar feature-based cascade classifier. Then, the watershed technique is applied to segment a region of interest (RoI) of a muzzle area in the detected region of the cattle face. This muzzle ROI is further enhanced to make ridge lines more outstanding. The next step, using two approaches, is to extract a main feature descriptor based on a bag of histograms of oriented gradients (BoHoG) and a histogram of local binary patterns (LBP). Then, the support vector machine (SVM) is applied with the histogram intersection kernel for a final cattle identifier. The proposed method is evaluated using five different datasets including one existing cattle dataset used in previous research works, one newly collected dataset of swamp buffalo captured in a controlled environment, and three newly collected datasets of swamp buffalo captured in an outdoor field environment. This outdoor field environment includes challenges of freely moving cattle and differences in daylight. It could achieve a promising accuracy of 95\% for a large dataset of 431 subjects. }

We first use several preprocessing steps on the binary image in order to eliminate the spurious lakes and dots, and to reduce the spurious islands, bridges, and spurs in the skeleton image. By removing all the bug pixels introduced at the thinning stage, our algorithm can detect a maximum number of minutiae from the fingerprint skeleton using the Rutovitz Crossing Number. This allows the true minutiae preserved and false minutiae removed in later postprocessing stages. Finally, using the intrinsic duality property of fingerprint image we develop several postprocessing techniques to efficiently remove spurious minutiae. Especially, we define an H-point structure to remove several types of spurious minutiae including bridge, triangle, ladder, and wrinkle all together. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithms.}

ABSTRACT = {Cattle, buffalo and cow identification plays an influential role in cattle traceability from birth to slaughter, understanding disease trajectories and large-scale cattle ownership management. Muzzle print images are considered discriminating cattle biometric identifiers for biometric-based cattle identification and traceability. This paper presents an exploration of the performance of the bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) approach in cattle identification using local invariant features extracted from a database of muzzle print images. Two local invariant feature detectors&mdash;namely, speeded-up robust features (SURF) and maximally stable extremal regions (MSER)&mdash;are used as feature extraction engines in the BoVW model. The performance evaluation criteria include several factors, namely, the identification accuracy, processing time and the number of features. The experimental work measures the performance of the BoVW model under a variable number of input muzzle print images in the training, validation, and testing phases. The identification accuracy values when utilizing the SURF feature detector and descriptor were 75\%, 83\%, 91\%, and 93\% for when 30\%, 45\%, 60\%, and 75\% of the database was used in the training phase, respectively. However, using MSER as a points-of-interest detector combined with the SURF descriptor achieved accuracies of 52\%, 60\%, 67\%, and 67\%, respectively, when applying the same training sizes. The research findings have proven the feasibility of deploying the BoVW paradigm in cattle identification using local invariant features extracted from muzzle print images.},

abstract={The usage of computer vision adds a new paradigm in the field of animal biometric, and has recently received more attention due to the growing importance of identification and tracking of animal species or individual animals. Biometric characteristics help to develop a better representation and a better identification of different animal species and individual animals. In this work, we propose an effective approach for automatic cattle recognition based on the multiple features of muzzle points and the cattle face images. The proposed method deals the cattle recognition problem as a classification problem among the multiple linear regression models and provides a new theory for the recognition of individual cattle. The group sparse signal representation based classification offers the key to addressing this problem using L2-minimization. In this paper, a comparative study among the well-established handcrafted texture feature extraction techniques and the appearance-based feature extraction techniques is also presented. A detailed set of experimental results on muzzle point image database is also carried to prove the theory. Our method has achieved 93.87{\%} identification accuracy which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method than the other existing machine learning based recognition algorithms.},

abstract={Animal biometrics is an emerging research field that develops quantified methodologies for representing and detecting the visual appearances of animal based on generic features and primary biometric characteristics. The identification of individual cattle is an important issue for classification of different breads, their registration, traceability, health management, and verification of false insurance claim throughout the world. To solve these major problems, the muzzle (nose) point image pattern of cattle is a suitable and primary biometric characteristic for the recognition of cattle. The recognition of muzzle point images is similar to the recognition of minutiae points in the human fingerprints. In this paper, we propose a hybrid feature extraction approach for the automatic recognition and classification of cattle breeds based on captured muzzle point image pattern features using low- cost camera. The major contributions of this research is based on following aspects: (1) preparation of muzzle point image dataset, (2) extraction of salient set of features and (3) K-nearest neighbour (K-NN), Fuzzy-KNN, Decision Tree (DT), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Naive Bayes classification models are applied to recognition, and classification of individual cattle using their muzzle point pattern. This paper, therefore, demonstrates the automatic recognition and classification of livestock using the set of extracted muzzle point image features. The experimental results show that proposed hybrid feature extraction and recognition approach outperforms the current state-of- the art method for the identification of individual cattle using their muzzle point image pattern.},

It also employed the AdaBoost classifier to identify head of cattle from their WLD features. To validate the results obtained by this classifier, other two classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Fuzzy-k-Nearest Neighbor (Fk-NN)) were used. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach achieved a promising accuracy result (approximately 99.5\%) which is better than existed proposed solutions. Moreover, to evaluate the results of the proposed approach, four different assessment methods (Area Under Curve (AUC), Sensitivity and Specificity, accuracy rate, and Equal Error Rate (EER)) were used. The results of all these methods showed that the WLD along with AdaBoost algorithm gave very promising results compared to both of the k-NN and Fk-NN algorithms.}

abstract="The accuracy of animal identification plays an important role for producers to make management decisions about their individual animal or about their complete herd. The animal identification is also important to animal traceability systems as ensure the integrity of the food chain. Usually, recording and reading of tags-based systems are used to identify animal, but only effective in eradication programs of national disease. Recently, animal biometric-based solutions, e.g. muzzle imaging system, offer an effective and secure, and rapid method of addressing the requirements of animal identification and traceability systems. In this paper, we propose a robust and fast cattle identification through using Gabor filter-based feature extraction method. We extract Gabor features from three different scales of muzzle print images. SVM classifier with its different kernels (Gaussian, Polynomial, Linear and Sigmoid) has been applied to Gabor features. Also, two different levels of fusion are used namely feature fusion and classifier fusion. The experimental results showed that Gaussian-based SVM classifier has achieved the best accuracy among all other kernels and generally our approach is superior than existed works as ours achieves 99.5{\%} identification accuracy. In addition, the identification rate when the fusion is done at the feature level is better than that is done at classification level.",

Animal biometric-based solutions, e.g. muzzle imaging system, offer an effective and secure, and rapid method of addressing the requirements of animal identification and traceability systems. In this paper, we propose a robust and fast cattle identification approach. This approach makes use of Local Binary Pattern (LBP) to extract local invariant features from muzzle print images.

In addition, the results proved that our proposed method achieved this high accuracy even if the testing images are rotated in various angels or occluded with different parts of their sizes.",

abstract = {Increased biosecurity and food safety requirements may increase demand for efficient traceability and identification systems of livestock in the supply chain. The advanced technologies of machine learning and computer vision have been applied in precision livestock management, including critical disease detection, vaccination, production management, tracking, and health monitoring. This paper offers a systematic literature review (SLR) of vision-based cattle identification. More specifically, this SLR is to identify and analyse the research related to cattle identification using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). This study retrieved 731 studies from four online scholarly databases. Fifty-five articles were subsequently selected and investigated in depth. For the two main applications of cattle detection and cattle identification, all the ML based papers only solve cattle identification problems. However, both detection and identification problems were studied in the DL based papers. Based on our survey report, the most used ML models for cattle identification were support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), and artificial neural network (ANN). Convolutional neural network (CNN), residual network (ResNet), Inception, You Only Look Once (YOLO), and Faster R-CNN were popular DL models in the selected papers. Among these papers, the most distinguishing features were the muzzle prints and coat patterns of cattle. Local binary pattern (LBP), speeded up robust features (SURF), scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), and Inception or CNN were identified as the most used feature extraction methods. This paper details important factors to consider when choosing a technique or method. We also identified major challenges in cattle identification. There are few publicly available datasets, and the quality of those datasets are affected by the wild environment and movement while collecting data. The processing time is a critical factor for a real-time cattle identification system. Finally, a recommendation is given that more publicly available benchmark datasets will improve research progress in the future.}

abstract = {Beef cattle identification in a livestock management framework is an important issue. It is related to registration and traceability which are very important for breeding, production and distribution of the beef cattle. The muzzle pattern as a mean of identification has been studied since 1921 and several papers have proven that it can be used in the case of the cattle identification. The muzzle pattern has characteristic like the human’s fingerprint. In this study, the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) approach has been evaluated for the identification purpose based on biometrics and compared with methods from the previous two research papers. The numbers of matched-keypoints have been defined as the matching score. The matching refinement technique based on the keypoint’s orientation information has been proposed to eliminate the miss-matched keypoints so that the identification performance is increased. Based on the experimental results which use data consisting of 160 muzzle pattern images from 20 individuals, the original SIFT approach has had the best performance compared to the previous methods with the value of the Equal Error Rate (EER) being equal to 0.0167. The proposed matching refinement technique has successfully reduced the false matching so that the value of the EER has been decreased to 0.0028. The SIFT approach and the proposed matching refinement technique can be a potential method for the beef cattle identification based on the image of the muzzle pattern lifted on paper.}

    abstract = { Cattle muzzle classification can be considered as a biometric identifier to maintain the livestock and guarantee the safety of cattle products. This paper presents a muzzle-based classification system using multiclass support vector machines (MSVMs). The proposed MSVMs system consists of three phases; namely preprocessing, feature extraction and classifications. Preprocessing techniques, histogram equalisation and mathematical morphology filtering have been used to increase image contrast and removing noise respectively. The proposed system uses box-counting algorithm for detecting feature of each muzzle image. For a strong classification system and achieving more accurate classification result, MSVMs has been used. The experimental evaluation prove the advancement of the presented system as it achieve 96\% classification accuracy in case of increase number of classified group to ten groups compared to 90\% classification accuracy achieved by traditional classification system. }
