# Bachelor thesis assignment:

- Explore the possibilities of biometric-based identification specifically using human fingerprints for applicability to game identification. Focus on the possibilities of search and identification based on marker extraction.

- Study the methods used for fingerprint-based human identification and focus on the potential for use for snout-print-based game identification.

- Design an application for image processing and feature extraction to search for markers for game identification.
Implement your proposed solution.

- Evaluate the results obtained in terms of accuracy of marker search and suggest possible extensions to the application.
