## Project Description:

The goal of this project is to create a simple information system for tracking abandoned animals in an animal shelter (e.g., rabbits, cats, or dogs) and their potential borrowing and walking by volunteers. Each animal is identified by its name, species, and other relevant attributes (such as age, photos, or descriptions inspired by Mr. John Doe's animal descriptions, etc.). Each animal also has a history (e.g., information about how it was found) and a record of its health status (e.g., vaccination information) and regular check-ups by a veterinarian. Animals can be added to a walking schedule for potential walks. Verified volunteers can search for these animals, make reservations for borrowing them, and schedule walks based on available time slots in the schedule. The following roles will be present in the system:

### Roles:

- **Administrator**:
  - Manages users
  - Creates caregivers and veterinarians

- **Caregiver**:

- **Veterinarian**:
  - Handles requests from caregivers (plans examinations based on requests)
  - Maintains health records of animals

- **Volunteer**:

- **Unregistered User**:

### Possible Extensions:

- Creating a plan for medication administration to animals
- Other creative possibilities as described in the documentation...
